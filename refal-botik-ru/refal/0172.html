<P><EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | I also tried to download Refal-6, but I'm always receiving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | error messages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you recieve error messages when opening page or downloading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or running?
</EM><BR>
<P>I could read the page
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/index.html,">http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/index.html,</A>
<BR>
but I could not download
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/Refal6.zip.">http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/Refal6.zip.</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In fact I also couldn't enter my Refal6 site from www.refal.net,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I suggest to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm">http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this one worked. But I'm afraid I will not be able to make an efficient
<BR>
use of the system only with the documentation which is included in the
<BR>
distribution.
<BR>
<P>I was surprised to see that the Refal-6 executables are older than that of
<BR>
Refal-5. Isn't Refal developed further anymore?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alexandr have experimented with Refal-written XML-parser in Refal5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not that slow as one might anticipate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (As far as I remember that parser also allowed for attributes).
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for this reference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the way, may be it looks as anti-advertisement here, but I use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now myself the SML for processing XML.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also thought of using a language of the ML family, but unfortunatly I've
<BR>
been procrastinating to learn one of these languages for quite a long time
<BR>
now, and regarding the XML transformations I need some results quite
<BR>
quickly. When I found Refal, I was impressed by the simplicity and elegance
<BR>
of the language.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you wish, I could also share with you some of our tools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (nonvalidating parser, unparser).
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the offer, I possibly will approach you later regarding this.
