<BR>
| &gt; | I also tried to download Refal-6, but I'm always receiving
<BR>
| &gt; | error messages.
<BR>
| &gt; Did you recieve error messages when opening page or downloading
<BR>
| &gt; or running?
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| I could read the page
<BR>
| <A HREF="http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/index.html,">http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/index.html,</A>
<BR>
| but I could not download
<BR>
| <A HREF="http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/Refal6.zip.">http://www.refal.net/english/doc/ark_klimov/Refal6.zip.</A>
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| &gt; In fact I also couldn't enter my Refal6 site from www.refal.net,
<BR>
| &gt; so I suggest to try
<BR>
| &gt; <A HREF="http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm">http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm</A>
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| Yes, this one worked. But I'm afraid I will not be able to make an efficient
<BR>
| use of the system only with the documentation which is included in the
<BR>
| distribution.
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| I was surprised to see that the Refal-6 executables are older than that of
<BR>
| Refal-5. Isn't Refal developed further anymore?
<BR>
In fact Refal-6 has not been developed for 3 or 4 years. About 2 years ago 
<BR>
the current executables were built. Since then only a couple of errors have
<BR>
been fixed in script (=refal) parts of the system. (In 2000 I had a very active user).
<BR>
To-day I decided to update the distribution on the web. 
<BR>
However I failed to use its old address, 
<BR>
so the new address is <A HREF="http://gh218.keldysh.ru/refal6/">http://gh218.keldysh.ru/refal6/</A>
<BR>
(Leonid, will you please update the reference from refal.net).
<BR>
Please, try it and tell me if any problems arise.
<BR>
The distribitive file refal6.zip contains a brief info on the language 
<BR>
and on the usage of system, written in English. 
<BR>
But the full language documentation exists only in Russian,
<BR>
purhaps it is a difficulty for you... . Thus it might be better for you to use Refal-5
<BR>
instead, since there exist a book on Refal-5 in English written by V.Turchin.
<BR>
Generally speaking, Refal-6 is an extension of Refal-5, though libraries of
<BR>
built-in functions differ. The Refal-6 distribution contains a module which emulates
<BR>
complete refal-5 environment (except some of new extensions).
<BR>
Thus you can start from Refal-5 and in any moment switch to Refal6, if you find
<BR>
it worthy.
<BR>

<BR>
| &gt; [...]
<BR>
| &gt; Alexandr have experimented with Refal-written XML-parser in Refal5.
<BR>
| &gt; It is not that slow as one might anticipate.
<BR>
| &gt; (As far as I remember that parser also allowed for attributes).
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| Thanks for this reference.
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| &gt; [...]
<BR>
| &gt; By the way, may be it looks as anti-advertisement here, but I use
<BR>
| &gt; now myself the SML for processing XML.
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| I also thought of using a language of the ML family, but unfortunatly I've
<BR>
| been procrastinating to learn one of these languages for quite a long time
<BR>
| now, and regarding the XML transformations I need some results quite
<BR>
| quickly. When I found Refal, I was impressed by the simplicity and elegance
<BR>
| of the language.
<BR>
Surely, if you need just to have a good language for processing XML-data,
<BR>
I think Refal is the best choice. We use SML as a programming tool for our
<BR>
project, in which we need to input/output some XML data - thereby we use
<BR>
SML, not Refal, for managing XML as well.
<BR>
If I need to process XML in Refal I would start from writing a simple 
<BR>
XML-parser in Refal. Of cource I could save a couple of days if I had
<BR>
it ready. I think Alexandr Korkyukov (Alexandre Korlyukov
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;korlyukov@grsu.grodno.by&gt;) will provide you with some.
<BR>
The crucial question here is the representation of XML-document in the 
<BR>
form of Refal-expression. 
<BR>
<P>-- Arkady
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| &gt; If you wish, I could also share with you some of our tools
<BR>
| &gt; (nonvalidating parser, unparser).
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| Thanks for the offer, I possibly will approach you later regarding this.
