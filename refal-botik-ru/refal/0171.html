Hi, Helmut, 
<BR>
I appreciate your interest in Refal as a language for transormation of XML documents.
<BR>
I hope Alexandr Korlyukov will share with you much of his experience in this area.
<BR>
I wish to just answer your questions on Refal6 (see below)

Subject: Difficulties with the Refal System
<BR>
<P><P>| Hello,
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| on my search for a more suitable language (than XSL) for the transformation 
<BR>
| of XML documents I hit the Refal Web Site. I downloaded Refal-5 and did 
<BR>
| some tests. It seems as if the result of the built-in function XMLParse 
<BR>
| does not contain the XML attributes. Could please anyone who has experience 
<BR>
| with this function tell me, whether my observation is correct? Is there a 
<BR>
| possibility to get the attributes parsed into the result tree? I really 
<BR>
| need them, because I have to process real documents (not only data) where 
<BR>
| the attributes are used for the meta-information (for which attributes were 
<BR>
| meant originally). Is there a different XML parser for Refal available? To 
<BR>
| write the parser in Refal itself would probably lead to a not acceptable 
<BR>
| performance.
<BR>
| 
<BR>
| I also tried to download Refal-6, but I'm always receiving error messages. 
<BR>
Did you recieve error messages when opening page or downloading or running?
<BR>
In fact I also couldn't enter my Refal6 site from www.refal.net, so I suggest to try
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm">http://www.keldysh.ru/dpt_16/Refal6/index.htm</A>
<BR>
(perhaps the problem is with the case of letter R)
<BR>
<P>| If the XML support in Refal-6 is more mature: is there an implementation 
<BR>
| available?
<BR>
Infortunately, the answer is no. That is there is no specific XML support in Refal6 system.
<BR>
Hence one must just write everything in Refal including parser.
<BR>
Alexandr have experimented with Refal-written XML-parser in Refal5. 
<BR>
It is not that slow as one might anticipate. 
<BR>
(As far as I remember that parser also allowed for attributes).
<BR>
Please, do not hesitate to ask questions, if any,  I will help you with pleasure.
<BR>
<P>By the way, may be it looks as anti-advertisement here, but I use now myself the SML
<BR>
for processing XML. If you wish, I could also share with you some of our tools
<BR>
(nonvalidating parser, unparser).
<BR>
<P>Arkady
<BR>
<P>| 
<BR>
| Any hints are appreciated. Thanks in advance.
