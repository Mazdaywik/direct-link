<br />
Hello friend, <br />
<br />
I crave your indulgence as I contact you in such a surprising manner. But I<br />
respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will<br />
open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both of us. This business<br />
Transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your business<br />
activities, but I plead your assistance, as your flair for profitable business<br />
is needed. Permit me to introduce myself. <br />
<br />
I am Mr. ALIKA ULAKA Personal account manager of late Mr. Jim D Garner, I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this<br />
business opportunity in my department. Every five years, Nigeria banks transfer to its treasury millions of dollars of unclaimed deceased depositors funds in compliance with the banking laws and guidelines, in majority of cases with reference to my bank-UniversalTrust Bank Plc, the money normally runs into several millions of dollars. A foreigner, Late Engineer Mr Jim D Garner, an Oil Merchant/Contractor in Lagos Nigeria, until his death four years ago in a<br />
ghastly air crash has a closing balance of US10,500,000.00(Ten Million,Five<br />
Hundred Thousand Dollars) Ever since his death and up till this time of<br />
writing, no next-of-kin or relation of his has come forward to claim his money<br />
with us. <br />
<br />
Fervent valuable efforts have been made by Universal Trust Bank to get in touch with any of the Jim&apos;s family or relatives but proved to no avail.<br />
Naturally, as long as Jim&apos;s money remains unclaimed, the bank remains<br />
richer in free funds with his money. However, with my position, I can present<br />
you to claim the fund as a relative/next of kin if you agree with me on private<br />
basis. Yes, I can present you as i am the account manager of the dead man. <br />
<br />
The request for you as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact<br />
that the customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin to<br />
a foreigner,Hence, I plead for your assistance with the intention of getting<br />
this unclaimed money amounting to US10,500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only) transferred into a company/private bank account that you will present. <br />
<br />
You stand to gain a negotiable percentage of the fund if you agree to help me<br />
actualize this opportunity, I will not contact any other person until I am<br />
convinced that you are not interested in this proposal. Contact me immediately<br />
indicating your willingness and also give your direct and confidential fax and<br />
phone numbers for the effective communication that this transaction requires. I<br />
will furnish you with the procedure and also enlighten you on how the funds<br />
will be disbursed and shared on receipt of your response. I will also require<br />
your advice in the areas of investment as I plan to establish a business<br />
venture in your country with my share. Please reach me only on this private<br />
email address: alikaulaka@gawab.com or Tel: 234 803 7255069. <br />
<br />
Remember that a business of this nature needs to be keep confidential. <br />
<br />
Yours Sincerely <br />
<br />
ALIKA ULAKA. <br />
