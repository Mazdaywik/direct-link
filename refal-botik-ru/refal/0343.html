Bar.Abraham Gida, 
<BR>
B. A., M. A., J. P. 14, 
<BR>
Queens Court Towers, 
<BR>
Victoria Island Lagos – Nigeria.
<BR>
Attn: Dear Sir,
<BR>
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
<BR>
transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
<BR>
confidential and top secret. You have been recommended by an
<BR>
associate who assured me in confidence of your ability and
<BR>
reliability in prosecuting a business transaction of high net
<BR>
value requiring maximum confidentiality. I am the Secretary of
<BR>
the Contract Review Panel instituted by H. E. President
<BR>
Olusegun
<BR>
Obasanjo to probe/review all Contracts executed and payments
<BR>
made
<BR>
during the regime of late General Sani Abacha. I have been
<BR>
mandated by my colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance
<BR>
in the transfer of the sum of US$14.3 Million into your Bank
<BR>
Account. 
<BR>
As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of
<BR>
his government embezzled billions of dollars through spurious
<BR>
contracts and payments to foreigners between 1993 – 1998
<BR>
and this is now the subject of probe by my Panel. In the course
<BR>
of our review, we have discovered this sum of $14.3 Million,
<BR>
which the former dictator could not 
<BR>
ransfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of
<BR>
Nigeria
<BR>
before his sudden death in June 1998. 
<BR>
It is this amount that my Colleagues and I have decided to
<BR>
acquire for ourselves through your assistance. This assistance
<BR>
becomes crucial because we
<BR>
cannot acquire the funds in our names and as government
<BR>
officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign bank
<BR>
accounts. We have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and 
<BR>
totally risk free scheme through which the fund can be
<BR>
transferred to your nominated bank account within a very short
<BR>
time. 
<BR>
The scheme is to use our position and influence on the
<BR>
Panel to represent you as a 
<BR>
foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds. We shall arrange
<BR>
all
<BR>
documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the
<BR>
transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf. The
<BR>
scheme
<BR>
is perfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the funds can
<BR>
arrive your Account within 7 – 10 working days from when
<BR>
you agree to assist us. 
<BR>
You definitely have a lot to benefit from this trans
<BR>
ction as we are prepared to give you between 20% -25% of the
<BR>
total funds as soon as you secure it in your account. Please,
<BR>
endeavour to give me a telephone/fax number through which we
<BR>
can
<BR>
communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the
<BR>
need for secrecy is great to this transaction. We expect your
<BR>
urgent response.
<BR>
Yours faithfully, 
<BR>
Barrister Abraham Gida
<BR>
