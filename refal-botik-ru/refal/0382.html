<P>MUSA MHERE
<BR>
HARARE ZIMBABWE
<BR>
EMAIL:musamhere@freesurf.fr
<BR>
Sir/Madam
<BR>
<P>Naturally, this letter will come to you as a
<BR>
surprise since we have not met, permit me to
<BR>
introduce myself. I am MR Musa Mhere a
<BR>
Zimbabwean Farmer.
<BR>
I am contacting you as the need for me to have a
<BR>
foreign partner in your country has become necessary
<BR>
due to my plans to relocate and establish a private
<BR>
company in that region, as the present political
<BR>
instability in my country Zimbabwe, does not
<BR>
encourage financial investment as the environment is
<BR>
not conducive for investment and most of all
<BR>
security is not insured, just as reported by
<BR>
international media. I got your contacts through
<BR>
personal research and out of desperation I decided
<BR>
to reach you through this medium. I will give you
<BR>
more information as regards to this as soon as you
<BR>
reply and I repose great confidence in you hence my
<BR>
approach due to security network place on us and I
<BR>
hope you will not let me out to security personnel.
<BR>
This problem started when the Zimbabwean government
<BR>
under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe
<BR>
announced a decree on May 31st 2000 to seize more
<BR>
than 849 white-owned farms. So far, more than 1,400
<BR>
white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated,
<BR>
as well as claiming the properties of the farmers.
<BR>
Consequently, most of my colleagues and our
<BR>
properties were seized again putting us to total
<BR>
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the
<BR>
administration of President Mugabe in my country and
<BR>
we where subjected to psychological torture by the
<BR>
security agents in the country. Some of my friends
<BR>
are still under detention, although arrangements are
<BR>
being made for their release, now I have no
<BR>
confidence with anybody within my country.
<BR>
During these periods, as reported by some
<BR>
international media including the CNN, so many white
<BR>
farmers were killed, the government is not stopping
<BR>
at this, as just recently the government have asked
<BR>
all white-farmers to give up their farms to black
<BR>
farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in
<BR>
this country Zimbabwe for so many years, I have no
<BR>
other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my
<BR>
distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact
<BR>
you, for your assistance, so that I can establish a
<BR>
company in your country and relocate there. Also, I
<BR>
must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen
<BR>
of your country to front as the owner of the
<BR>
enterprise, due to the fact that I am a foreigner.
<BR>
For this purpose, I have put in a security deposit
<BR>
all monies from the sale of my farm and farming
<BR>
equipments (including tractors etc) which amounted
<BR>
to US$12Million, I had to move the money out of the
<BR>
country through a very secret arranged channel in a
<BR>
very unconventional method by my friend an official
<BR>
at the &quot;Security Minting &amp; Printing Company&quot; of my
<BR>
country. Presently, the money is in an Oversea
<BR>
Country, under the custody of a private security 
<BR>
firm whose name is withheld for now until we open
<BR>
communication.
<BR>
I will upon receiving your consent prepare every
<BR>
document to enable you receive this money on my
<BR>
behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your
<BR>
country so that we can both make further
<BR>
arrangements with regards to establishing the
<BR>
company. As a partner you will be entitled to 20%
<BR>
stake in whichever company that we both decide to
<BR>
establish when I arrive your country.
<BR>
I am waiting urgently for your response and please
<BR>
treat with utmost confidentiality.
<BR>
<P>Best Regard
<BR>
