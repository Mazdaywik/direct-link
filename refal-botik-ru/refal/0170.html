Hello,
<BR>
<P>on my search for a more suitable language (than XSL) for the transformation 
<BR>
of XML documents I hit the Refal Web Site. I downloaded Refal-5 and did 
<BR>
some tests. It seems as if the result of the built-in function XMLParse 
<BR>
does not contain the XML attributes. Could please anyone who has experience 
<BR>
with this function tell me, whether my observation is correct? Is there a 
<BR>
possibility to get the attributes parsed into the result tree? I really 
<BR>
need them, because I have to process real documents (not only data) where 
<BR>
the attributes are used for the meta-information (for which attributes were 
<BR>
meant originally). Is there a different XML parser for Refal available? To 
<BR>
write the parser in Refal itself would probably lead to a not acceptable 
<BR>
performance.
<BR>
<P>I also tried to download Refal-6, but I'm always receiving error messages. 
<BR>
If the XML support in Refal-6 is more mature: is there an implementation 
<BR>
available?
<BR>
<P>Any hints are appreciated. Thanks in advance.
