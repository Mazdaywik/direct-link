<BR>
<P>ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR/PRESIDENT 
<BR>
<P>In other to transfer (USD$56 Million Dollars) from our 
<BR>
bank, I have the courage to ask you to look for a 
<BR>
reliable and honest person who will be capable of this 
<BR>
important business believing that you will not let me down. 
<BR>
<P>I am MR. ADAMS HURNT the eastern district bank manager of united bank for Africa plc (UBA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1990 and 
<BR>
since 1999 nobody has operated on this account again. 
<BR>
After intensive investigations, I discovered that if I 
<BR>
do not find a way to get the amount in question 
<BR>
stacked out somewhere safe urgently it will be forfeited for 
<BR>
nothing. The owner of this account, ENGR. SMITH U. 
<BR>
WILLIAMS, a foreigner, the manager of Petro- technical 
<BR>
support services, a chemical Engineer by profession 
<BR>
and he died in 1999 and no other person knows about 
<BR>
this account or any other beneficiary. My 
<BR>
investigations prove to me as well that this company 
<BR>
does not know anything about this account and has no 
<BR>
attachment to the said amount. The amount involved is 
<BR>
56 MILLION USD (FIFTY-SIX MILLION UNTIEDSTATESDOLLARS) 
<BR>
ONLY. 
<BR>
<P>In the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to 
<BR>
open your door to this opportunity by providing your 
<BR>
account or any account of your choice where the fund 
<BR>
will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a 
<BR>
safe foreigner’s account abroad but I don’t know any 
<BR>
one who could actually assist, I am only contacting 
<BR>
you as a foreigner because this money can only be 
<BR>
approved to a foreign account because the money is in 
<BR>
US Dollars and the owner of the account ENGR. SMITH U. 
<BR>
WILLIAMS and a foreigner too. 
<BR>
<P>I know that this mail will come as surprise to you as 
<BR>
we don’t know ourselves, but be sure that is for real. 
<BR>
<P>I got your contact believing that you will not 
<BR>
let me down in this business. 
<BR>
<P>You are the only person that I have contacted for this 
<BR>
business, so please reply urgently so that I will let 
<BR>
you know what steps to take next. Send also your 
<BR>
private telephone, fax and mobile number for easy 
<BR>
communication including the full details of the 
<BR>
account to be used for the deposit. 
<BR>
<P>I am contacting you because of the need to involve a 
<BR>
foreigner with foreign account. I need your full 
<BR>
co-operation to make this work out alright. Your 
<BR>
assistance as foreigner is necessary because the 
<BR>
management is ready to welcome any person, a foreigner 
<BR>
who has correct information of this account, which I 
<BR>
will give to you immediately, if you are interested to 
<BR>
conclude this transaction with me. If your are capable 
<BR>
of handling such amount in strict confidence, keeping 
<BR>
to my instructions I need a sincere person for this 
<BR>
venture because I don’t want to make mistake, I need 
<BR>
your strong assurance that this money will be intact 
<BR>
pending my arrival in your country for sharing. You 
<BR>
should be informed strictly that I will burn all the 
<BR>
documents in your presence immediately after this 
<BR>
money has been remitted to your account leavingnotrace 
<BR>
to any place. 
<BR>
<P>I will apply for annual leave immediately I hear from 
<BR>
you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in 
<BR>
your account. This is to enable me use my position and 
<BR>
influence to effect legal approvals for onward 
<BR>
transfer of this money to your account with 
<BR>
appropriate clearance forms of the 
<BR>
ministries and foreign exchange department. 
<BR>
<P>At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 
<BR>
20% of the total amount, 70% will be for us and 10%for 
<BR>
any expenses incurred during the transaction. 
<BR>
