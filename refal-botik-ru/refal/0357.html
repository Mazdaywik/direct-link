Attention:
<BR>
I am Dr.Victor Lawson, pleased to send my greetings to
<BR>
you. I know this letter will definitely come to you as
<BR>
a surprise  package.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I am extending this proposal to you in my capacity as
<BR>
chairman of the  contract Review/Audit Committee
<BR>
scrutinizing all record covering executed  contract
<BR>
awarded by previous military government of Nigeria.
<BR>
Mycolleagues and I have uncovered a floating amount of
<BR>
USD$25,500,000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED
<BR>
THOUSAND U.S.DOLLARS), without a clear beneficiary 
<BR>
owing to a deliberate act of over invoicing and
<BR>
inflating of contract value by some government
<BR>
officials.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This money (USD$25.5M), has already been approved for
<BR>
payment by the ministry of Mines, Power and Steel and
<BR>
is secured under Contract
<BR>
No:MMP/FGN/V1233/ALSCON-29,Job Completion Certificate
<BR>
No: 677000000242MMPS/C, of 17th oct.2001. As top civil
<BR>
servants we are not  authorized to operate foreign
<BR>
bank account and this is why we want to use  your bank
<BR>
account to transfer this money outside  Nigeria. We
<BR>
have accepted  you as our foreign partner and will now
<BR>
regularize the approvals to you as  the trust
<BR>
beneficiary of the contract sum.
<BR>
&nbsp;As soon as we receive your acceptance, we shall
<BR>
inform you of the necessary  requirements from you of
<BR>
facilitate transfer.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Let us use this opportunity and export the benefit 
<BR>
of this sum. We have  resolved to give 20% of the
<BR>
total sum as compensation for your assistance, 70% is
<BR>
for me and my partners here in Nigeria, 10%  is set
<BR>
aside to cover every expenses made in the course of
<BR>
the transaction.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Note that this should be confidential.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yours faithfully,
<BR>
Dr. Victor Lawson..
<BR>
<P>NB.
