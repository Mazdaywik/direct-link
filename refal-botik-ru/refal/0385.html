A PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL.
<BR>
I am Mr.ANDY OLONGA Bank Manager of Gulf bank plc Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. Mr.BUTLER SHELDON made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18.2 Million dollars (Eighteen Million, two hundred thousand united state dollars) in my branch.
<BR>

<BR>
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but we got no reply.
<BR>
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, AGIP OIL that Mr.BUTLER SHELDON died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. BUTLER SHELDON did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.
<BR>

<BR>
This sum of US$18.2 million has been sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of two years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
<BR>

<BR>
In other to avoid this funds being lost to a corrupt government, myself and my colleagues decided to move this deposit to Europe where it has currently been kept in a security, finance and vault company for safe keeping pending when we could be able to secure a foreign partner to help in investing it into a lucrative projects. .
<BR>

<BR>
1) I would like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address, telephone/fax number.
<BR>
A bank account will be required of you in any part of the world, during the course of this transaction from the bank to facilitate the transfer of this money to your bank accounts as the beneficiary/next of kin of Mr.BUTLER SHELDON. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and 30% for you then 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may occur during the transfer process. There is no risk at all as All documents relating to the deposits are all here with me. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and to prepare all relevant documents. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Upon your arrival here in Rotherdam, we shall both go directly to the security company where you would have the opportunity to inspect the funds and all necessary arrangement for an immediate transfer of the funds to you
<BR>
r nominated accounts.
<BR>
Awaiting your urgent reply. 
<BR>

<BR>
Thank you so much for your time and best regards to your family.
<BR>

<BR>
MR. ANDY OLONGA.<BR>
