<BR>
Nigeria.
<BR>
<P>Dear Sir,
<BR>
I am Hamza Bello, with Accounting Department,Ecobank
<BR>
here in Nigeria,I got your very good name and e-mail
<BR>
address from the online classified posted on the net.I have decided to
<BR>
contact you purely on the personal conviction of trust and confidence
<BR>
that we can co-operate with one another and do a very lucrative
<BR>
business for our mutual benefit. I am proposing to you this
<BR>
in respect of the sum of US$20,000,000.00 (Tuenty Million
<BR>
United States Dollars Only,which was 
<BR>
deposited in a Dollar account with my bank which belonged to Mr
<BR>
Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim who died on 25th July,2000 in an autor crash,
<BR>
.My bank has made several efforts at
<BR>
contacting the family of Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim or his relatives, but all
<BR>
have proved abortive as he had no identifiable kin's men. This sum
<BR>
of US$20 M have remained unclaimed, ever since then nobody has come forward as his next of kin.
<BR>
The management under the influence of our chairman and member of
<BR>
the board of directors has made an arrangement for the fund to be
<BR>
declared 'UNCLAIMABLE' and subsequently be turned to the reserve
<BR>
account of the bank. It is against the background of the foregoing,
<BR>
that two of my colleagues and myself in the bank have decided to
<BR>
contact you for assistance and partnership, for you to stand as the
<BR>
next of kin to Mr Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim . With your permission this
<BR>
fund will be transferred to your private account abroad as the
<BR>
beneficiary and next of kin to Mr Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim.
<BR>
All proof of claim and necessary documentation will be carefully
<BR>
worked out in your favour and we assure you of 100% risk free
<BR>
involvement and protection. Consequently, if you find this proposal
<BR>
acceptable to you and you wish to assist us,reply immidiately as  I expect your urgent
<BR>
response and upon receipt of that,we shall discuss and agree on the
<BR>
disbursement and sharing ratio.Let me therefore expect your very
<BR>
urgent response through my, e-mail addresses. Please
<BR>
endeavour to include your private phone and fax numbers. Please keep this proposal very secret
<BR>
and confidential. You can get back to me on this private email address:- 
<BR>
hzbpt01@yahoo.com
<BR>
Thank you and best regards as I await your urgent response.
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,
<BR>
Hamza Bello
