<P>
Dear SIR/MADAM,
<BR>
<P>I am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman, we are
<BR>
the children of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone.
<BR>
&nbsp;I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your
<BR>
assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00)
<BR>
now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money
<BR>
is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late 
<BR>
father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, 
<BR>
although my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.
<BR>
<P><P>Source of the money:
<BR>
<P>My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in
<BR>
&nbsp;the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager 
<BR>
of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown .
<BR>
&nbsp;According to my father, this money was the income accrued from 
<BR>
Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor
<BR>
sales.
<BR>
<P><P>Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces 
<BR>
of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG
<BR>
peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country,
<BR>
following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected
<BR>
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had
<BR>
already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother,
<BR>
my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND,
<BR>
with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in 
<BR>
Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team.
<BR>
<P>During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of
<BR>
Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone
<BR>
mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed.
<BR>
My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked 
<BR>
and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship 
<BR>
with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
<BR>
<P>As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's
<BR>
involvement in the air crash in January it dashed our hope of survival. 
<BR>
The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related
<BR>
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have 
<BR>
spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister
<BR>
and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help.
<BR>
Without any relation,we are now like refugees and orphans.
<BR>
<P>Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security
<BR>
Firm To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.
<BR>
<P>1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our beneficiary
<BR>

<BR>
<P>3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our 
<BR>
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager
<BR>

<BR>
the total amount will be for your effort and another 5 % to cover all the
<BR>
expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I urge
