DEAR SIR/MRS,<br>
I am an Accountant with GULF BANK PLC, My name is<br>
JUMBO MATHINS a Banker, I am the personal Account Manager<br>
to Engineer Richard Walker, a foreign National , who<br>
used to work with Summit Oil company in Nigeria.Here in<br>
after shall be refered to as my client On May 12, 2000, my<br>
client, his wife, and their three children were involved in<br>
a car accident along Aba/Port harcout express way. All<br>
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.<br>
Since then I have made several inquiries to your embassy to<br>
locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also<br>
proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful<br>
attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the<br>
Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I<br>
contacted you. I have<br>
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and<br>
property left behind by my client before they Get<br>
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this<br>
huge deposits were lodged,<br>
particularly the GULF BANK PLC. Where the deceased had<br>
an account Valued at about ($12 Million U S Dollars) has<br>
Issued me a notice to provide the next of kin. Or have the<br>
account confiscated within the next ten official working<br>
days.<br>
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for<br>
over 2 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the<br>
next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last<br>
name so that the<br>
proceeds of this account valued at ($12 Million U S Dollars)<br>
can be paid to you and then you and me<br>
Can share the money.70% to me and 30% to you. An attorney<br>
will be contracted to help us revalidate and notarize all<br>
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up<br>
any claim we may<br>
make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us<br>
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be<br>
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect<br>
you. from any breach of the law.<br>
