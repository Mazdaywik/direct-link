<P>
Dr.Jackson Bello
<BR>
&nbsp;Nigeria National Petroleum corporation (NNPC)
<BR>
Lagos-Nigeria 
<BR>
<P>ATTENTION:PRESIDENT/CEO,
<BR>
<P>I am Dr.Usman Ahmed,Chairman of the Tender Committee of the Nigerian 
<BR>
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My Committee is principally 
<BR>
concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 1998 to date, in 
<BR>
order of priority as regard capital projects of the NNPC. The information 
<BR>
we gathered from the Foreign Office of the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce 
<BR>
and Industries is so positive as to convince us that you would provide 
<BR>
us with solution to a money  transfer deal valued at Thirty One Million 
<BR>
United States Dollars and subsequently a joint business venture. In the 
<BR>
course of our duties as values, and project inspectors for the on-going 
<BR>
liquefied Natural Gas(LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of 
<BR>
some jobs done by foreign contractors for
<BR>
the NNPC to the tune of US$31M. As follows: - Computer optimization and 
<BR>
Installation $16,000.000.00 Installation of 250,000.00 Monax 
<BR>
Turbine$10,000.000.00 Turn Around Maintenance $5,000,000.00 Our aim of 
<BR>
over-invoicing this payment is to divert the excess 
<BR>
amount to a discrete account abroad. This fund is now
<BR>
floating in suspense account at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This 
<BR>
is the fund my colleagues and I have decided to transfer into your 
<BR>
account since we, as civil servants are not allowed to operate or own 
<BR>
foreign account. The money will be shared as follows after transfer:30% for 
<BR>
you (Account Owner) 60% for me and my colleagues10% to off-set both 
<BR>
local and international expenses thatWould be incurred in the course of 
<BR>
this transaction. To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting 
<BR>
your company to be the original contractor / beneficiary of the funds so 
<BR>
all procedures for international transfer shall be strictly followed,as 
<BR>
we have worked out all modalities for a swift and riskfree transfer. 
<BR>
If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me with 
<BR>
the following important information. 
<BR>
Your Bank Name / Address Account Name ,Account
<BR>
NumberTel/Fax Telex of Bank,with your Personal 
<BR>
Phone / Fax Numbers for easy communication. This
<BR>
transaction will last for 14 working days from the time we submit the 
<BR>
required information, as all modalities concerning this transaction have 
<BR>
been worked out and it is completely risk free. 
<BR>
<P>Please be informed that this subject is classified
<BR>
sensitive. Therefore treat the transaction with utmost
<BR>
confidentiality and urgency. 
<BR>
<P><P>Yours Faithfully. 
<BR>
<P>Dr. Jackson Bello. 
<BR>
Chairman of the Tender Committee(NNPC).
