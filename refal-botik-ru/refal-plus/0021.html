How are you? I'm Kwang from Korea Advanced Institue of Science and
<BR>
Technology. (We talked over email back in April 1996!)
<BR>
<P>I'm writing to you to see if you can help me circulate our job-openning
<BR>
announcement among Russian scientists. We recently started a research
<BR>
center and are looking for two research fellows. I would very much
<BR>
appreciate it if you can circulate the enclosed job-openning notice among your
<BR>
colleagues. Or, could you give me some pointers to relavant people
<BR>
that I should contact with? 
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
<P>-Kwang

<P>            ROPAS: Research on Program Analysis System
                <A HREF="http://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/ropas">http://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/ropas</A>
           National Creative Research Initiative Center
          Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology 
<P>Our recently-started ROPAS center, which is generously supported by
the National Creative Research Initiative Program of the Korea
Ministry of Science and Technology, is actively looking for 2 research
professors (Ph.D.) and research staffs of Ph.D.- or M.S.-level. 
Applicants should have background and interest in one or more of the
following areas:
<P>      semantic-based program analyses
      program specification and proof
      computational logics and calculi
      compiler systems for HOT (higher-order, typed) programming languages
      compiler systems for conventional imperative languages
      programming language semantics
      programming environment and tools
      functional/object-oriented/logic programming
<P>The center's flagship project is The LET Project: program analysis for
generating smalL, safE, and smarT code , which focuses on HOT language
compilers for generating codes that are as small as possible, can be
checked against safety violation, and are self-optimizing. The
center's research staffs will cooperate on compiler systems,
programming language theories, and semantics-based static analysis.
<P>- The appointment is initially for one to three years with a potential
  renewal for the next three years.
- Salary is competitive, negotiable, and commensurate with experience.
  It ranges from 20K-50K USdollars/yr.
- Air fares for relocation will be provided.
- All financial supports for outstanding studies (e.g.,expenses for
  research travels and international collaborations) will be fully available.
- The ROPAS center is expected to last for the next nine years
  contingent upon three three-year evaluations.
- Some detailed information is available at <A HREF="http://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/ropas/">http://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/ropas/</A>
<P>If you are interested, please direct inquiries and applications (resume,
publication list, 3 reference letters, and research plan) to
<P>  Prof. Kwangkeun Yi

KAIST is widely accredited the Korea's most prestigious university for
science and engineering. It has about 2500 undergraduate students,
about 3000 graduate students, and about 400 faculty members. A general
information about KAIST is available in its web page (<A HREF="http://www.kaist.ac.kr">http://www.kaist.ac.kr</A>) 
or the cover article of the Nature's July 1993 issue. We are located
140kms (90 miles) south of Seoul, inside a cozy Taeduk Science Town.
