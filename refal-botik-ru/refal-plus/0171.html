Dear Sir,
<BR>
<P>Greetings to you and your family. I want you to read this mail with a compassionate
<BR>
heart and understanding that any action you take is geared towards rendering
<BR>
humanitarian assistance to a man who is in distress with his family.
<BR>
<P>My name is Mr.Milton Teahjay, a Liberian and former Deputy Minister of Information
<BR>
under former President Charles Taylor. I was his right hand man when he
<BR>
was in power until a particular time I realised that my entire life was
<BR>
in utmost danger after the assassination of the Sports Minister in a helicopter
<BR>
crash. I was responsible for the diamond deals with the RUF rebel group
<BR>
of Sierra Leone. I was handling the diamond sales on behalf of former President
<BR>
Taylor who in turn supplies ammunition to the rebels. This is what the international
<BR>
community and United Nations code-named: Conflict Diamond.
<BR>
<P>It was while I was discharging this duty that I diverted the sum of US$
<BR>
30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) for myself.
<BR>
I deposited the money contained in 2 trunk boxes in a Security Company as
<BR>
artifacts to avoid prying eyes in Accra, Ghana and travelled back to my
<BR>
country where I continued with my duties. I informed former President Charles
<BR>
Taylor that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSL) seized the
<BR>
diamond consignment and made report to the United Nations. It was based
<BR>
on this diamond dealings involving former President Taylor that the United
<BR>
Nations imposed sanctions on
<BR>
Liberia recently and it was also what led to his been removed from the seat
<BR>
of power.
<BR>
<P>My aim is to look for a trusted foreign partner outside to help me move
<BR>
the fund out for investment. It is based on my decision to move the fund
<BR>
out for investment that I am contacting you to assist me in taking the funds
<BR>
to your country .All you need do is to fly down to claim the 2 Boxes from
<BR>
the Security Company and open a bank account through which the money will
<BR>
be lodged before transfer into your nominated
<BR>
Bank account.
<BR>
<P>I am willing to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your assistance
<BR>
and want to let you understand that the future of myself
<BR>
and family depends solely on this money .In this transaction confidentiality
<BR>
is very essential for us to achieve our goal. It is important that you maintain
<BR>
utmost good faith and trust .You must
<BR>
also not circumvent the transaction in any way.
<BR>
<P>In conclusion I will like you to understand that you shall bear no risk
<BR>
whatsoever in this business and as such there is nothing for you
<BR>
to be afraid of. I await your swift response to this email.
<BR>
<P>Milton Teahjay.
